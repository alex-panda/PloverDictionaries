# Plover Dictionaries

## my_plover_dict
A dictionary of random breifs that I find useful.

## fingerspelling
This dictionary has all the fingerspelling breifs changed to make them more
intuitive. All that means is that they are changed so that you type the same
thing as before but the first letter of you finger-spelling does not put a
space before it. If you want a space before the finger-spelling, then you have
to manually type "SP" in order for a space to be produced. This is useful when
you just don't know how to finish off a word normally and you just want to
fingerspell the rest of it.

## book_plover
This is just a dictionary of random breifs.

## plover_apost_fixed
Often, when writing fancier text that is not meant for coding or something like
that, you want to use fancy apostrophies and not the normal straight ones.
This dictionary fixes all the words in the normal dictionary that have straight
apostrophies and makes them the fancy curled type.
